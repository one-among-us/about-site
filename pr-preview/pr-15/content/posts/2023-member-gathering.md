# One Among Us Holds Successful Annual Member Gathering Event

In a heartwarming display of unity and progress, One Among Us, the registered not-for-profit organization dedicated to supporting the East Asian and East Asian-Canadian transgender and gender diverse community, held its highly successful annual member gathering event on September 16, 2023. This year's gathering proved to be a milestone, marked by reflection on past accomplishments and ambitious plans for the future.

The event, attended by members and allies from across the region, was a testament to the organization's commitment to fostering a sense of belonging, understanding, and empowerment within the community. It provided a platform for sharing experiences, learning from one another, and collectively envisioning a more inclusive future.

At the beginning of the meeting, the room filled with the poignant strains of "Star Tour Song" as attendees joined their voices together. This moving tribute served as a heartfelt reminder of the friends who had passed away, a touching acknowledgment of their enduring presence within the community, and a symbol of the unity that One Among Us stands for.

One of the highlights of this year's gathering was the presentation of the organization's previous work. One Among Us has been diligently working on identifying and addressing the unique needs of the Chinese-speaking transgender and queer society. Through dedicated research and outreach efforts, the organization has made significant strides in understanding the challenges faced by this community and in developing tailored support systems.

The unveiling of the "Transgender University Guide" and the "Trans in Academia!" group were met with enthusiastic applause. These initiatives represent a crucial step toward creating more inclusive spaces within academic institutions. The Transgender University Guide aims to provide resources and guidance for transgender and gender diverse individuals pursuing higher education, ensuring they have access to a supportive and nurturing environment. The "Trans in Academia!" group, on the other hand, serves as a platform for individuals within academia to connect, share experiences, and advocate for a more inclusive academic culture.

During the event, members engaged in lively discussions about the future of One Among Us. The organization's commitment to its mission of love, remembrance, and unity was reaffirmed, and ambitious plans were laid out to further expand its reach and impact. The participants emphasized the importance of education and outreach, intending to increase awareness and understanding of transgender and gender diverse issues within the broader community.

In line with their dedication to inclusivity, One Among Us expressed its intention to continue collaborating with other organizations, educational institutions, and policymakers to advocate for transgender and gender diverse rights. The organization's vision includes creating safe spaces, offering support and resources, and promoting acceptance and understanding among all individuals, regardless of their gender identity.

The annual gathering concluded with a sense of hope despite the hard situation of our community. It served as a powerful reminder of the strength and resilience of the East Asian and East Asian-Canadian transgender and gender diverse community. As One Among Us looks toward the future, its commitment to its members and allies remains unwavering, reflecting the belief that, together, they can create a more inclusive and accepting world for all.

The success of this year's annual gathering was not just a celebration of past achievements; it was a launchpad for a brighter, more inclusive future. One Among Us continues to be a shining example of an organization dedicated to making a positive impact and fostering a sense of belonging within the transgender and gender diverse community.
