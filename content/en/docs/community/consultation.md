# Consultation about Life in Toronto

If you are a trans, queer, or gender diverse immigrant currently in, or considering moving to, Toronto or nearby regions, and have a question about the life here, you are welcome to contact <MailTo template="toronto [at] oneamongus [dot] ca" /> to schedule a consultation with us. When contacting us, please briefly describe your question(s) and tell us the city/region/province that you are interested in.

Consultations are available in the formats of text messaging or audio/video meetings. We can answer questions regarding, but not limited to, the following topics:

- Finding a medical provider (e.g. for <abbr title="Hormone Replacement Therapy">HRT</abbr>, surgery attestation letters, etc.)[^hcc]
- Legal name change
- Correction of gender marker on a Canadian government-issued ID
- General advice on housing/medical/employment discrimination

This service is free of charge, and available to people regardless of their immigration status. You do **not** need to provide a legal name or "real name" to access this service. The service is provided on a peer-support, best-effort basis. We will try to answer your questions based on our experience in the community and publicly available information, and we do not provide legal or medical advice.

Privacy policy: We will only retain information you give us when you contact us to schedule the consultation. **Do not include sensitive information in the email correspondance**, because email is not encrypted. The consultation itself will not be recorded, and we do not share your information without getting your consent first. If the consultation is in text messaging format, and the platform allows it, we will delete the conversation history after you were given the chance to make a copy of it. However, individual meeting or messaging platforms may have their own privacy policy, which may be less strict than ours. Thus, **if you have any preference for the platform to use, please let us know** and we will do our best to satisfy your needs. For best security, it is recommended to use a platform with end-to-end encryption. To address your issue, we may, upon your consent, refer you to a professional, who might need you to provide more personal information to them, and might have a less strict privacy policy.

This service is also available in [Mandarin Chinese](/zh-Hans/docs/community/consultation).

[^hcc]: If you are looking for a primary care provider and you have <abbr title="Ontario Health Insurance Plan">OHIP</abbr>, please consider using the [service provided by the Ontario government](https://www.ontario.ca/page/find-family-doctor-or-nurse-practitioner) first. Thank you!
