# Become a Member

On October 5th, 2025, we passed through our Annual General Meeting a new approach to meeting and welcoming our new members. Generally, it is called New Member Recruitment Programs (NMRP) in section 8.05 of our by-law.

We will release updates of our latest NMRPs on this page from time to time. You can also get information from our social media or contact us via email. 

Please note that NMRP is not a paid opportunity. Generally, our membership is not for those paid by us. Also, since we are a small organization, we **do not have any paid employees** as of October 31st, 2025. "Managers", "Vice Presidents", and "Directors" (including the "Executive Director") are all non-paid member positions. Should we have any paid employees in the future, they are not to be named after these terms. 

## In Progress

No NMRPs are in progress.
