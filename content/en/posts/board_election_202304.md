Since Cassie Z. (CC) noticed us their resignation from her position starting from 2023 Apr 22, One Among Us has to elect a new director in replace of them to meet the Not-for-Profit Corporations Act in Ontario.

The following new director was nominated by the Board of Directors and passed by the members to serve the rest of the 1-year term starting from 2023 Apr 22 to 2023 December with our current directors, Azalea G. and Yvette W:
