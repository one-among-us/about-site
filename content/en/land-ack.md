# Land Acknowledgment of One Among Us Toronto Service Group

We acknowledge here that One Among Us (Toronto) sits on the traditional territories of many nations, including the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishnabeg, the Chippewa, the Haudenosaunee and the Wendat peoples, and within the lands protected by the “Dish With One Spoon” wampum agreement. The land is still home to many Indigenous Peoples within Turtle Island and what many understand as North America.

We acknowledge the contributions of all Indian Residential school survivors, child apprehension survivors, Indigenous women, Trans Two Spirit and Queer peoples who were displaced from their territories, and all who have been displaced by generations of international colonialism and theft of people, communities, labour, and resources from the continent of Africa, South and East Asia, and around the world. We acknowledge the contributions of all who continue to work for justice and truth-telling against all forms of oppression in Canada, East Asia, and around the world. We commit ourselves to this ongoing work.
